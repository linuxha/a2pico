A2Pico is about Apple II peripheral cards based on the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/). It consists of two parts:
* Several [hardware](#a2pico-hardware) reference designs
* A [software](#a2pico-software) library for projects based on A2Pico

## Background

Soon after the introduction of the Raspberry Pi Pico in 2021 [Glenn Jones](https://github.com/a2retrosystems) and I started to experiment with directly connecting
it to the Apple II slot bus. In 2022 I published a working Pico firmware on GitHub. Based on that we started to implement the _A2retroNET_ project which I presented
at KanasFest 2023 (https://youtu.be/ryiH8t4yIuw).

In the meanwhile [Ralle Palaveev](https://github.com/rallepalaveev) created his own _A2Pico_ hardware for the firmware I had published before. In contrast to the
hardware I presented on KansasFest, _A2Pico_ consisted completely of through-hole components which allow for very easy DIY assembly. However, at that point my Pico
firmware relied on the behavior of components only available as SMD fine-pitch packages. Therefore _A2Pico_ had some functional limitations.

Considering the next steps after presenting the prototype at KansasFest I decided that my firmware should be accessible to the DIY community so I teamed up with Ralle
to modify both hardware and firmware to enable full functionlity with through-hole components only and without any PLDs.

Ralle has now developed an _A2Pico_ variant with SMD components for efficient automated assembly. Both _A2Pico_ variants are 100% functionally identical.

Additionally I wanted to establish a software library that avoids duplication of low level code into the different firmware projects that all share the same hardware.
The name _A2Pico_ is now used for both the common hardware and the common software.

## A2Pico Hardware

* TH [card](https://apple2.co.uk/Products#a2pico-th-card) and [design](https://github.com/rallepalaveev/a2pico/blob/main/A2Pico.v2.6)
* SMD [card](https://apple2.co.uk/Products#a2pico-smd-card) and [design](https://github.com/rallepalaveev/a2pico/blob/main/A2Pico.v2.7)
* SMD [card](https://jcm-1.com/product/a2pico/) for the U.S.

### Theory of Operation

/DEVSEL, /IOSEL and /IOSTRB are combined to ENBL via an AND gate. A0-A7 and D0-D7 are multiplexed to the same GPIOs. D0-D7 direction is controlled by GPIO.

### GPIO Mapping

| 3 - 14 | A0 - A11 |
| 3 - 10 | D0 - D7  |
| 15     | R/W      |

### Flashing of a Firmware

Every A2Pico firmware is flashed in the same extremly simple and foolproof way. It doesn't matter wether the A2Pico card is inserted into an Apple II slot or not.
Just make sure the Apple II turned off if the A2Pico is inserted.

1. Press and hold the `BOOTSEL`button on the A2Pico.
2. Connect the A2Pico to a PC.
3. Release the `BOOTSEL`button. A new drive, `RPI-RP2`, will appear.
4. Copy the firmware `.uf2` file to the `RPI-RP2` drive, e.g., by drag & drop.
5. Disconnect the A2Pico from the PC. Done.

### Theory of Operation

There are three PIO state machines: __addr__, __read__ and __write__. The ARM core 0 is operated in a traditional way: Running from cached Flash, calling into the
C library, being interrupted by the USB library, etc. However, The ARM core 1 is dedicated to interact with the three PIO state machines. Therefore it runs from RAM,
calls only inline functions and is never interrupted.

On the falling edge of ENBL, the the __addr__ state machine samples lines A0-A11 plus R/W and pushes the data into its RX FIFO. In case of a 6502 write cycle, it
additionally triggers the __write__ state machine. The ARM core 1 waits on that FIFO, decodes the address parts and branches based on R/W.

In case of a 6502 write cycle, the __write__ state machine samples lines D0-D7 ~300ns later and pushes the byte into its RX FIFO. By then, the ARM core 1 waits on
that FIFO and processes the byte.

In case of a 6502 read cycle, it's up to the ARM core 1 code to produce a byte in time for the 6502 to pick it up. As soon as it has done so, it pushes the byte
into the __read__ state machine TX FIFO. That state machine waits on its TX FIFO and drives out the byte to the lines D0-D7 until the rising edge of ENBL.
